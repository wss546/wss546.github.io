abstract = "A 1550-nm all-fiber pulsed laser Doppler vibrometer (LDV) based on time-domain chopping (TDC) techniques is developed to overcome demodulation failures caused by multipath interference. The system adopts an adjustable configuration on pulse duration and pulse repetition frequency according to the distance. An experiment is carried out at a 25 m standoff with a pulse duration of 80 ns, single pulse energy of 0.4 nJ, and pulse repetition frequency of 1 MHz. A waveform and spectrogram of the demodulated voice show that the pulsed LDV system has a good performance in long-range voice listening."
