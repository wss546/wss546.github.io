abstract = "In order to obtain a high-quality single-longitudinal-mode output from a TEA CO2 laser, a study on a TEA CO2 laser with seed injection locking is carried. A virtual confocal resonator with transmission is proposed. The evolution of the cavity mode is simalated by Prony's method of the Glad software. The near-field and far-field intensity distributions are recorded with the experiment of seed injection locking is carried out. The experimental results show that there is a beat signal with a frequency of 195 MHz when the oscillation of unstable resonator is free. When the seed injection is successfully locked, the output laser beat disappears, the waveform becomes smooth, the peak power is reduced by 48.6%, the pulse generation time is shortened by 20ns. The experimental results agree well with the existing results, which verifies that the TEA CO2 laser with such a transmissive unstable resonator has the ability to output a high-quality single longitudinal mode."
