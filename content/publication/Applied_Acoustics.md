abstract = "All-fiber laser Doppler vibrometer (LDV) systems have great potential in the application of remote acoustic detection. However, the system performance is impaired due to the serious intermediate frequency (IF) crosstalk signal, which is caused by the fiber circulator. In this paper, a system adopting a partial-fiber structure is pro- posed and analyzed. Simulative and experimental analysis indicate that the IF crosstalk signal is mainly caused by the fiber circulator, and it damages demodulation signal. In order to reduce the IF crosstalk signal, a po- larization prism is employed to substitute the circulator. Experimental results reveal that the IF crosstalk signal can be eliminated by the partial-fiber LDV effectively. The comprehensible speech signals within the range of 50m can be obtained."
