Laser Doppler vibrometers analyze samples of different size, from entire car bodies, large aerospace parts over engines and actuators to micron-sized MEMS or delicate HDD components. Numerous other research applications in mechanical and civil engineering, biology and medicine benefit from the superior properties of non-contact Vibrometry. Laser vibrometers easily master challenging conditions like measuring on hot surfaces, on rotating parts, and characterize complex and sensitive structures even in the ultrasonic frequency range.
